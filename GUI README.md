Hello Professor,

As far as I am aware, I have no used any sort of additional libraries to make the code run - just utilizing a library called Java swing that creates components that I generate on the screen 
by setting its bounds. It should still be entirely runnable in the command line terminal similar to any c++ code. 

There are several .java files in this repo, but the one that starts the GUI properly is imgoinginsane.java, which acts as the main file for the entire program. The other pages are all generated
as objects that are called via the actionlistener functions, which are always located at the bottom of each class. 

At the top of each class are the objects that have been declared for use. They are almost entirely made of JComponents - Labels, buttons, and textareas. 

The remainder of the code is just positioning the JComponents, ensuring variables are displaying the correct names, and calling data from the C++ files that we will be turning in in tandem. 

There was one final bug relating to displaying the tips after the YES/NO survey that made the formatting incredibly weird and causing several nullpointerrors upon me trying to fix them - I created a bandaid solution to present with, and will turn it in aswell since it is what I chose to present with. If you want the broken nullpointer code, just let me know.

Thank you for the incredible semester,
and I will probably be taking Assembly with you in the fall. 

Thanks, 
Eric
